1. What does 'socket.connect()' do in the context of UDP?
In UDP, connecting a socket allows for the use of socket.send(), which auotmatically sends data 
to the IP address and Port specified in the tuple argument passed into socket.connect(). It also 
means that instead of using recvfrom(), we can use recv, read or recvmsg  since the only incoming data 
will be from the port and address from connect(). Lastly, socket.connect() upon a successful connection, 
allows for the returning of asynchronous errors. These errors are useful for returing more information 
(such as IP and port of a failed connection), which recvfrom, can not do. 

2. Explain 'socket.send()' vs 'socket.sendto()' in the context of UDP. 
Both socket.send() and socket.sendto() are very similar in their overall functions. For socket.send() 
to be used, the socket must be connected to a remote socket via socket.connect(), and will send data 
via the connected socket using the port and IP. If the socket does not have a remote connection, 
socket.sendto() is used to send data. It requires the address as an additional argument as opposed 
to socket.send(). Both functions send data to the address, the difference is socket.send() will always 
send over the connected socket, while socket.sendto() could be used multiple times to send to different 
addresses, but the address must be specified.
