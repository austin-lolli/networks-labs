1. Why is chunk_size and packet_size different? 
They are different because chunk_size is strictly for reading from the file, while 
packet_size is larger because it needs to include the chunk of data, but also the 
sequence number and checksum. 
 
2. Explain the idea of a checksum in the context of this lab. 
A checksum is a way of ensuring that a message was delivered intact. The checksum 
for this lab appears to be the encoded data modulo 256 (presumably for the 8-bit 
characters). By computing the checksum on both ends and comparing it, it is easy to 
confirm that the data arrived as it was sent, and if it wasn't the computed 
checksum will not match the sent checksum. 

3. What is serialization and deserialization? 
Serialization is a way of converting an object into a string format. This is useful 
because things such as a dictionary can not be encoded, so by serializing it first, 
it can then be sent. Deserialization is the opposite of this, it takes something 
that was previously serialized and converts it back to the original format. 

4. Ideas to handle lost messages and missing acknowledgements (full stop and wait)?
We could change the client to where if it doesn't receive an acknowledgement after a 
timeout (i.e. the client did not receive the acknowledgement from the server, either 
because the server did not receive the packet or the acknowledgement was lost), it would 
then resend the message to the server. This is one way to implement the full stop and 
wait protocol, because while the current implementation only resends if the acknowledgement 
sequence is the same as the last packet sent, this implementation would resend the packet 
in any case except for when the acknowledgement signal was equal to the sequence number of
the next expected packet.
